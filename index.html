								<h2>(REDSHIFT) - Building photo editor for Android</h2>
								<p>
									05/01/2022 - I'm currently working on a new pet project on my spare time, a photo editor for Android using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin Coroutines. It is still in its early stages but if you want to get access to it and provide feedback reach out to me on twitter (DM).

								<p>Trying to make the most of the Christmas break, I started reading 
									<a href="https://twitter.com/Peter_shirley">@Peter_shirley</a>'s book on Ray tracing:
									<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">"Ray Tracing in one weekend"</a>.
									I had a rough understanding of how raytracers work, but this book gave a more intuitive grasp on the subject.

								<p>I was plasently surprised to learn that images like the one above can be generated without using any graphics library. I am using OpenGL but just to render a texture, I could have instead outputted a image file and then open it with an image viewer (this is in fact what the author does in this book).
								The code for the project <a href="https://github.com/feresr/raytracing">is available on Github</a> and I've documented some of<a href="https://twitter.com/fernandoraviola/status/1210211800492453889?s=20"> my takeways on twitter</a>.

								<h2>Three.js and React</h2>
							
								<p>
									After learning about WebGL for the past few months I decided to make my life easier and started using <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>.
									I took this <a href=https://threejs-journey.com/>Three.js course</a> by Bruno Simon and I absolutely loved every bit of it. 
									Then I took it a step further and started to play around with React-three-fiber. It's amazing how fast you can prototype using web tools, at least compared to how things are done in Android. I made a demo app that allows to display your mobile application in 3D by replacing the texture on the phone screen with your own, as always <a href="https://feresr.github.io/csb-jy3uc/">code is here</a><br>

								<h2>Building a multi-purpose 16-bit computer</h2>
								
								<p>My curiosity to understand how programming really works and what a computer is actually doing led me into a rabbit hole.

								<h2>Learning 3D graphics with OpenGL</h2>
							
								<p>For the long	est time I thought I wanted to make video games, but every time I set out to build one I would almost immediatelly get bored. 
									This happened multiple times. I would spend hours researching the best game engine, downloading it, playing around with it, starting a new project only to abandon it a few weeks later.
									I thought by making a game, I would understand how they work under the hood.</p>

								<p>
									In practice, that's not true. Game Engines do most of the heavy lifting for you, some go as far as providing a drag and drop interface that will allow you to make your game a reality in record time.
									That's what game engines are supposed to do! And that doesn‚Äôt mean making games using a game engine is easy, there's plenty of challenges (both technical and artistic) that go into making a good game. 
									Those are just not the challenges I'm most interested in.

									Graphics are a huge part of games so I decided to learn OpenGL for the sake of understanding how graphics API works and how computers draw things on the screen. It's been a rewarding experience so far! This is what I have to show for. a very rudimentary Phong-blinn renderer that suppors model loading via the Assimp library.
									As always <a href="https://github.com/feresr/renderer">the code is available on Github</a>.
